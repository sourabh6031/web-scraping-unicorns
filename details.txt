In this project I have scraped most searched words across India.

Library I have used were-
pandas for data frame,
requests for connecting url to machine,
BeautifulSoup, bs4 that is BeautifulSoup,a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files.

using iteration in codes for grabbing all 'th','tbody' and 'tr' tags to get the values.

Then I define the structure of dataframe using pandas and after storing it, I saved it to the csv file.
